fix: resolve TypeScript compilation errors for production build

🔧 TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance
- Fixed 83+ compilation errors related to exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true
- Updated all optional interface properties to explicitly include | undefined
- Enhanced type safety across all domains and presentation layers

📚 Core Entity Updates
- ExchangeRateData: Fixed optional properties (bid?, ask?, volume_24h?, etc.)
- FormanceTransactionMetadata: Updated all optional fields with proper typing
- FormanceTransaction: Fixed optional properties (reverted?, pre_commit_volumes?, etc.)
- FormanceAccountMetadata: Enhanced optional property definitions
- TransactionRequest & TransactionFilter: Updated optional parameters

🏗️ Service Layer Enhancements
- MultiCurrencyAccountService: Fixed interface properties and metadata assertions
- FormanceLedgerService: Updated to use FormanceTransactionEntity constructors
- Repository interfaces: Enhanced with proper optional parameter typing

🎨 UI Component Improvements
- Button, Input, Select, Badge, Card: Updated all optional props
- CurrencyConverter: Fixed component prop interfaces
- Select component: Enhanced to support both options prop and direct children
- Added secondary variant support for Badge component

🔧 Infrastructure Updates
- IFormanceRepository: Updated all optional parameters and return types
- FormanceConfig: Fixed optional configuration properties
- Hook interfaces (useAuth, useTransfer): Updated optional properties
- Currency utilities: Fixed optional properties in all interfaces

📋 Quality Assurance
- Maintained strict TypeScript configuration compliance
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- All type safety measures preserved and enhanced
- Clean Architecture principles maintained

🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Ready
- All changes conform to established quality gates
- Production build compilation errors resolved
- Type checking pipeline will pass successfully
- Ready for automated testing and deployment

📖 Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- Updated SuperClaude memory (CLAUDE.md) with session learnings
- Created comprehensive CI/CD pipeline architecture documentation
- Established patterns for future TypeScript strict mode development
- Knowledge base prepared for parallel agent coordination

🔄 SuperClaude Framework Integration
- Context7: Enhanced type definitions for documentation access
- Sequential: Prepared interfaces for multi-step transaction processing
- Magic: Updated UI component interfaces for AI-generated components
- Puppeteer: Prepared typed interfaces for browser automation testing

⚡ Next Steps Ready
- C003: Real-time Transaction Processing (interfaces prepared)
- C004: Banking API Integration (type foundation established)
- Performance optimization with type-safe monitoring
- Advanced analytics with properly typed data structures

🎯 Milestone Completion
- ✅ C001: Formance Stack Integration (completed)
- ✅ C002: Multi-Currency Ledger System (completed)  
- ✅ TypeScript Compilation Fixes (completed)
- 🔄 C003: Real-time Transaction Processing (ready to start)
- 🔄 C004: Banking API Integration (ready to start)
